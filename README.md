KiCad 3D models for footprints
====================




My KiCad footprint 3D model collection. These are based on datasheets, random websites, personal experience and anything else I could get my hands on.

These are additional 3D models for use with my footprint libraries (you can find them at https://github.com/StefanHamminga). For more info check out my site at: https://prjct.net
Feel free to contact me if you have suggestions, questions, improvements or other comments.
